# textEditor
 This is a Java application utilizing the Java Swing library which functions as a basic text editor. 
 
 When the program is run, a GUI is launched so that the user can interact with their text files.
 
 The File menu in the GUI lets the user open an existing file in the text area, start writing a new file, 
 save changes to an existing file, save a new file by providing a file name, and exit the text editor.
